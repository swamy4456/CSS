            Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing, 
            longer than sentences, but shorter than sections
            , chapters, or entire works. Becausethey connect
             the “small” ideas of individual sentences to a 
             “bigger” idea, paragraph structure is essential 
             to any writing for organization, flow, and comprehension.
